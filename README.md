# ArXiv ChatBot ðŸ“„ðŸ¤–

## Overview

This is the repo for my ArXiv ChatBot application, deployed with Vercel [here](https://arxiv-bot-ui.vercel.app).

This application uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) on the frontend and [LangChain JS](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs/) with [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) on the backend to handle document loading and question answering over the document.

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser
5. Load a paper and start asking questions!

## Acknolwedgements

Thank you to Zahid Khawaja ([GitHub](https://github.com/zahidkhawaja)), whose [langchain-chat-nextjs](https://github.com/zahidkhawaja/langchain-chat-nextjs) repo was the initial inspiration for this project.

Also, thank you to James Briggs ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@jamesbriggs), [GitHub](https://github.com/jamescalam)), whose LangChain videos sparked my interest in these topics and led me down this path of discovery.

Finally, thank you to Harrison Chase ([GitHub](https://github.com/hwchase17)) for creating LangChain and the incredible community around it. Both creations make building with LLMs incredibly simple and enjoyable!
